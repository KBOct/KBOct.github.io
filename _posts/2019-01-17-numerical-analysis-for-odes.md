Here's some basic text

And here's some *italic*

Here's some **bold** text

What about a [link](https://github.com/kboct)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First
+ Second
- Third


Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
import numpy as np

def test_function(x,y):
  z=np.sum(x,y)
return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

C code block:
```c
include <stdio.h>
# DEFINE code = 6
```

C++ code block:
```c++
int m,n,o;
m=m++  
```

VBA code block:
```vba
Public Sub test()
Dim a As String
a="lol"
MsgBox a
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`
