Here's some basic text

And here's some *italic*

Here's some **bold** text

What about a [link](https://github.com/kboct)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First
+ Second
- Third


Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
{% highlight python linenos %}
import numpy as np

def test_function(x,y):
  z=np.sum(x,y)
return z
{% endhighlight %}


Here's some inline code `x+y`

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1- numerical analysis for ODEs/image1.jpg" alt="scilab numerical analysis plot" class="full">


Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1- numerical analysis for ODEs/image1.jpg)
{: .full}

Here's some math :

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
