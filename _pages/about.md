I'm a student in a French leading quant programme.

I like to implement quantitative models in a variety of settings and programming languages.

I also dabble in Data Science and Machine Learning (scored A both on the exam and on the Kaggle challenge project that can be found [here](/porto-seguro-kaggle-challenge))
